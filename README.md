# Git Flow Workflow

## Branches:

- **master**: Production-ready code only  
- **develop**: Integration branch for features  
- **feature/**: Feature branches created from develop  
- **release/**: Pre-release branches created from develop  
- **hotfix/**: Emergency fixes created from master  

## Workflow:

1. Develop new features in `feature/*` branches.  
2. Merge features into `develop`.  
3. Prepare for release in `release/*` branch.  
4. Merge release into both `develop` and `master`.  
5. For urgent fixes, use `hotfix/*` branches from `master`.
